# ThediServer

# Node + Express Service Starter

This is a simple API sample in Node.js with express.js based on [Google Cloud Run Quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/quickstarts/build-and-deploy/deploy-nodejs-service).

## Getting Started

Server should run automatically when starting a workspace. To run manually, run:
```sh
npm run dev
```

To run from [Google IDX](https://idx.google.com) clone both `https://github.com/kephothoX/ThediFrontend` and `https://github.com/kephothoX/ThediServer` and import them directly to your workspace.
